/* GA4 ONLY. GTM-W9LDWCQ7 was removed from this landing page app on 2026-08-15 at
   Joe's direction. Measured live that day it delivered Microsoft Clarity session
   recording, the Meta pixel, Bing UET and a DoubleClick view-through remarketing
   beacon onto patient-intake pages. Neither Microsoft nor Meta will sign a BAA.

   The container itself was NOT edited, and must not be: PNW Hair's own website
   serves the same container, so editing it would strip that site's own analytics
   and retargeting. Scope is the landing page fleet only.

   allow_google_signals:false is load-bearing. Without it, GA4 linked to Google Ads
   keeps building the same remarketing audiences off the same page views and
   removing the beacon achieves nothing (H-32). */

/* HEALTH-INTENT ROUTE GATE — added 2026-08-17 with the /c/consult build.

   /c/consult collects a name, email, mobile, a Norwood/Ludwig selection and a
   prior-procedure answer. That is health-intent input in a form, and H-26 /
   §6 failure mode 7 make a browser analytics tag on such a page non-waivable
   at the skill layer; these practices are BAA-covered and Google will not sign
   one for GA4. Server-side delivery would not launder it either (H-32) — the
   restriction follows the data, not the pipe.

   SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW: this suppresses the tag on the consult route
   ONLY. It does not change any existing page. The wider question — that this
   app also runs GA4 on its other /c/ and /m/ consult and evaluation form
   pages, which are the same shape — is a real finding and is Joe's call, with
   the RHRLI precedent being that he directed GTM removed from the landing
   pages fleet-wide on 2026-08-15. Do not widen this gate without that call.

   Suppressing a tag on a medical page can only ever reduce exposure, so this
   edit cannot hide a violation. */
